Technical Assessment - Generation SG (Jr Full Stack Developer Course)

Java Programming Fundamentals - OPP Java Assessment

Assessment objectives:
- Work on OOP programming concepts in Java.
- Analyse a program and figure out the missing implementations.
- Complete the program with the intended functionalities.
- Provide coverage to catch checked exception(s) to prevent program halt.
- Convert the existing Java project to a Maven project structure.
- Setup and perform several unit tests with JUnit 5.

#### What did you like about this project?
I find this project to be an excellent opportunity to work on unit tests, where I have little hands-on practice in. 
Through this project, I see that unit testing is another area that I can work on to be a better programmer, especially in software that adopt the Test Driven Development approach.

#### What did you struggle with in this project?
I had a few tries changing the project structure to a Maven project, then adding jUnit dependencies to it thereafter.

#### What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I find this project to be challenging and hope can get more time considering that it includes topics like exception handling and unit testing.
