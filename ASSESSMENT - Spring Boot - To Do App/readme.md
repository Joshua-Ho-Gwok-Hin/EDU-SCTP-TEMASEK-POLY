# Challenge Project: StudentGen Project in Github
Technical Assessment - Generation SG (Jr Full Stack Developer Course)

Java Spring Boot MVC App - Java Web Assessment

Assessment objectives:
- Build a REST API application using Java.
- Complete a Spring project.
- Build a feature that works well with testing.

#### What did you like about this project?
I find this project to be an excellent opportunity to work on Validations using some of the constraints @Annotations from the jakarta.validation.constraints package.
This framework comes in handy as it provides many built-in annotations(e.g. credit-card, email) to maintain data integrity for the backend.

#### What did you struggle with in this project?
While working on the tutorial, I missed some important detail when conducting Postman testing. 
Spent quite some time to figure out that I've missed out some of the "/" slashes.

#### What would make your experience with this assessment better?
It would be nice if there is a completed frontend demo to integrate to our backend API.

#### Which feature did you select to build and why?
I have selected to build the validation and handle the errors that do not pass validations using Spring's Validator interface from org.springframework.validation.Errors.
Using the Errors interface is more like an experimental approach.

#### [Instructor](https://github.com/thinktinker)'s recommendations after this assessment's review
- [x] Improve on test reliability without the implications of using Mockito.lenient()
