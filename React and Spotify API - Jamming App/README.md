#### What did you like about this project?
This project presents a valuable opportunity for me to gain practical experience with React, specifically in integrating an external API (Spotify). Additionally, it provides hands-on exposure to the OAuth Security Framework. This combination of skills is highly sought after in today’s tech industry. 

#### What did you struggle with in this project?
Initially, the project requirements induced a sense of stress and pressure in me. However, after consulting with Max, a fellow cohort member, I came to understand that the project could be tackled incrementally, following the approach outlined on the Codecademy Kanban board.

#### What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I find this project to be very challenging as I need to do some revision on previous topics.
